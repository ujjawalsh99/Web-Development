  <h1>The Cab Connect Journey</h1>
  <p>Founded in India in 2019, Cab Connect now serves more than 2 million drivers, 200+ million customers across 250+ cities and 3 continents as the world’s 3rd largest ride-hailing app.<br><br>

  Cab Connect launched in the UK in 2018 across South Wales and the South West of England as the UK’s first ride-hailing app for both private hire vehicles and metered taxis. Within 6 months, we had travelled the equivalent of more than 500 times the length of the UK with the help of passionate, local drivers who take riders where they need to be, happily and safely.</p>
